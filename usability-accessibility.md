# Usability Heuristic
## Visibility of system status
The system status is clearly visible. Since the website's pages are rendered on the server and instantly delivered to the client (user computer/phone/etc browser), the "loading" status of the page is clearly and prominently displayed. Once the page is loaded, there's no more responsiveness to track until a link is interacted with.

## Match between system and real world
The system clearly matches common conventions of how websites work-- links are displayed with bigger fonts than their details as a vertical list, intra-page navigation (up and down that list) is accomplished by browser scrolling functionality, and a navigation bar is prominently displayed at the top of the page.

## User control and freedom
The aforementioned navigation bar at the top of the page, as well as link-centric user experience, provides ready, familiar navigation functionality.

## Consistency and standards
As said before, the aforementioned navigation bar and link-centric UX are congruent with user expectations of websites.

## Error prevention
The simple design of the website (it could have been built 10-20 years ago, before the complexity of client-side/JavaScript/"reactive" webpages) is fault-tolerant by design due to its lack of complexity and coupling. Attempting to access a nonexistent webpage is met with a simple "unknown" printed in plain text. 

## Recognition rather than recall
Again, the aforementioned navigation bar and link-centric UX are congruent with user expectations of websites.

## Flexibility and efficiency
As the website's user experience design is "barebones," users are limited only by their browser's functionality, affording them its inbuilt experience. For example, keyboard shortcuts for navigation are well-supported, because browsers support them. 

## Aesthetic and minimalist design
The website prominently displays a navigation bar at the top, matching user expectations, and links are displayed in a left-justified list from the top to the bottom of the page. No superfluous elements are present-- a single concept is corresponds with a single visual element.

## Error recognition and recovery
Given that Hacker News's content is displayed as HTML/CSS, without reactive state, there aren't errors from the website's end. Their only issue is their 404 (page not found) error, which displays "unknown" rather than "page not found."

## Help and documentation
As said before, the aforementioned navigation bar and link-centric UX are congruent with user expectations of websites. Additionally, due to its "techie"-focused user base, Hacker News needs to cater to new computer users less than a general public-focused website.
